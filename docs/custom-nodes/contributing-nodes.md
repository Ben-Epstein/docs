Currently There are two submodules in our project. The **nodes** submodule includes all the node definitions and node manifests.

### Contributing to Nodes Submodule

In order to contribute your own custom node,

- At first go to `PYTHON/nodes/` directory, then create your own **branch**. After creating your own custom nodes, you should push it to github and create a pull request to the main.
- After that, back to the **studio** root directory, you should also push it to the remote repository.

This way the **nodes** submodule will be tracked in the **stuio** repository by the latest commit hash.
