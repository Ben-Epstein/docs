The Iv curve node is used to record an IV Curve with Flojoy using a Keithley2400 sourcemeter.
It allows the user to set up serial communication (Comport and Baudrate) between his computer and a Keithley 2400 source meter.
Then, it is used to send voltages to the device and record current measurements to plot an I-V curve.
