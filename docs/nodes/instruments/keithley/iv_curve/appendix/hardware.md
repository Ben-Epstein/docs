## HARDWARE : 
In order to record an IV curve from an electric device (LED, Solar cells, etc,..) with Flojoy, you'll need a setup with :

- A Source meter Keithley 2400, which is able to send voltages to the electronic device and record current from it. It has its own nodes in the Flojoy application called KEITHLEY2400.
- A source of light that you'll use as a fake sun for calibrating the output of your solar cells. (You can also use the real sun by doing the experiment outside)
- A computer which is connected to the Keithley 2400 with a serial communication cable.
