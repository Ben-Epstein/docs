## Node Management

The LabJack Node doesn't need any data input, it can be the first node of the app :

- Set the parameter "sensor_numbers" for the LabJACKU3 node with the number of temperature sensors connected to your LabJackU3 device.

- Choose your Visualisation node that fits your project to display the temperature measurements (Histogram, Bar, Line, etc).  

- Use the loop node (See documentation) in order to update the temperature measurements, you can set the parameters you want for the loops (Delay, number of loops, etc..)
