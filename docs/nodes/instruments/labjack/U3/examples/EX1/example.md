The example above is showing a Flojoy app which allow you to use the LABJACKU3 and the loop nodes in order to record temperature measurements
and update them with time. Just set up your parameters and your visualization node before running the app :

- LABJACKU3 parameter "Numbers" needs to match the number of temperature sensors connected to your LabJackU3 device.

- Set the parameters you want for the LOOP and GOTO nodes : Delay, Number of loops, etc,.. (See LOOP tutorial for more info) 

- Choose your Visualisation node that fits your project to display the temperature measurements (Histogram, Bar, Line, etc).
