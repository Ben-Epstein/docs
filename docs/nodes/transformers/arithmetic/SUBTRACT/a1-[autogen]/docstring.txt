The SUBTRACT node can be used to subtract 2 or more numeric arrays, matrices, dataframes, or constants element-wise. When a constant is subtracted from an array or matrix, each element in the array or matrix will be decreased by the constant value. If 2 arrays or matrices of different sizes are subtracted, the output will be the size of the larger array or matrix with only the overlapping elements changed.
