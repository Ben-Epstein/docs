Welcome to Flojoy!

This introduction tutorial will guide you through the UI including how to create a simple app.

Upon starting Flojoy you should be greeted to a UI like this:

*UI at start up including an example app.*

The UI could look slightly different in your version of Flojoy. We're constantly improving the UI.

In this page, we will guide you through how to control the interface including: adding nodes, adding parameter controls, and running the app. First let's break down the UI.

### The UI

![image](/img/introduction/UI_2.png)
*Interface broken down into sections*

Here are the sections of the interface:

1) The red box outlines the app interface showing the nodes and the connection between them. You can drag and zoom in/out of the interface here as required.

2) The button in the green box toggles between dark and light color schemes for Flojoy. The file button in pink contains the controls for loading and saving apps. The play button runs the current app.

3) The status of the interface is shown here (e.g. waiting for a new job, running the job.)

4) The green box here shows the different tabs availble to you. The tab currently selected here is 'SCRIPT'. The 'CTRLS' tab is for controlling node parameters.

5) The 'Add Nodes' button opens the interface for addition of new nodes.



### Adding the required nodes.

When flojoy is first launched, an example app is shown. Simply delete all nodes by clicking on them and pressing backspace.

### Adding the CTRLS/parameters.

The next step is the addition of the CTRLS (controls) which allow control over behavior of indiviual nodes. In the top left of the interface, click "CTRLS". Then in the top right click on the grey switch next to "Edit". It will turn green. Click on the the "+ Add" button to add controls. A submenu will open allowing you to choose controls to add. 

### Running and saving the app.

At the top right of the interface click on "SCRIPT". You can then click the blue "Play" button at the top right to run the app. If one node turns red an error has occurred in that node. You can click on "DEBUG" to see a summary of  the output from each node.

To save the app for later use, click on "File -> Save As" in the top right and save the txt file with the desired name and location. You can also load an already saved app from here.
